Hello, Brother Androy is a long-time friend and Sister Uy is a sister.
오전 10:35:01
짧게밖으로내려가도록하겠습니다. 그가처음에말씀부탁을받았을때
I will make it brief, when he first received the assignment to speak
오전 10:35:09
어떤이야기를해야되는지사실고민을많이했어요. 제가뭐한때막감지기불타오른다이렇게느꼈던
I actually thought a lot about what story I should tell, I felt like something was burning inside me at that time.
오전 10:35:18
적이있었지만최근에는막 폭풍우가막몰아치면서글씨가남아있나그정도로.
There was an enemy, but recently, a fierce storm blew in, and the words were barely left, to that extent.
오전 10:35:26
되게좀많이사그라들었다고느꼈기때문에제가 이렇게특별한성천만원회원분들께
I felt that it had greatly diminished, so I am speaking to you, the special temple patrons.
오전 10:35:33
나눠줄게뭐가있지이렇게고민을하게되었습니다 제가기도를했어요기도를했는데
I wondered what I had to share, and so I prayed, and as I prayed
오전 10:35:42
그냥뭐가 지금알고있는게뭐냐네가지금
What do you know now
오전 10:35:43
라고물어보실
You asked what I know now
오전 10:35:52
그래서제가 그한가지가뭔지바로알수있었어요. 그것은바로기도에대한것입니다.
So I was able to know immediately what that one thing is, it is about prayer.
오전 10:36:02
저는기도가 하나님과의대화라는것을분명하게
I clearly understand that prayer is a conversation with God
오전 10:36:10
알고있습니다정말 단순한사실입니다우리는
I know it is really a simple fact we
오전 10:36:18
기도를통해하나님께말씀할수있고, 하나님은저희에게대답하십니다.
Through prayer, we can speak to God, and God answers us.
오전 10:36:26
우리가 때로는벽에대고말하는것같고허공에대고말하는것같은데
It sometimes seems like we are talking to a wall and speaking into the air.
오전 10:36:34
저희가하나님아버지라고부르는순간 너무나놀랍게도하늘이열리고
The moment we call Him Heavenly Father, amazingly, the heavens are opened
오전 10:36:40
하나님이우리의기도를드리십니다.
God hears our prayers.
오전 10:36:52
때하나님이기도를들어주지않았다고얘기합니다
At times God does not answer prayers.
오전 10:36:52
많은사람들이기도를 우리가기도를했어요근데아내가원하는대로되지않아
Many people prayed and we also prayed, but it did not happen as my wife desired.
오전 10:37:02
저는그것이사실이아니라는것을알고있습니다 우리가원하는대로되지않을때도있어요?
I know that is not true, there are times when things do not go as we desire.
오전 10:37:10
하지만중요한것은하나님께서는 우리보다더많은걸알고계시고우리의최선을원하시기때문에
But the important thing is that God knows more than we do and desires our best.
오전 10:37:18
때로는우리가원하는걸즉시읽어주지않을때가 있다는것입니다하지만그거는들으십니다듣고계십니다.
Sometimes He does not give us what we want immediately, but He hears and is listening.
오전 10:37:27
여러분은그것을여러분이기도할때 느끼실수있습니다여러분이기도할때
You can feel it when you pray, when you pray
오전 10:37:36
정말친구랑대화하듯이한번멈춰보시고 한번여러분에게느끼는느낌의귀기울여보시기바랍니다
I hope you stop for a moment and listen to the feelings you have as if talking to a close friend.
오전 10:37:45
개인적으로저한테는때로는 소름돋는것같이따뜻한느낌이주어질때도있고,
Personally to me, there are times when a warm feeling is given that is sometimes chilling.
오전 10:37:54
때로는이생각이막하와를타고들어가서어느생각에머무를때도 때도있고또때로는그어떤생각이계속막히는느낌을받을때도
At times, this thought penetrates deeply and lingers on a particular thought, and at other times, a certain thought continues to feel persistently blocked.
오전 10:38:02
있고전다양한방식으로하나님이저에게얘기하시는거를느낍니다. 여러분은분명히여러분에게갖는방법으로하나님이얘기하지
I feel that God speaks to me in various ways, and you clearly have your own ways that God speaks to you.
오전 10:38:12

그러므로너희는자신을성결하게하여너의생각을 오로지하나님께로만향하게하라그리하면너희가그를볼날일이니.
Therefore purify yourselves and let your thoughts be fixed only upon God that you may see Him in the day when you shall see Him.
오전 10:39:11
것이니라그리고이일은그 정한때에그가원하는방법으로또그
and this is according to his eternal decree which was from the beginning and also according to his fixed plan that he should bring to pass his gospel
오전 10:39:17
자신의뜻에따라이루어지리라.
according to his own will
오전 10:39:23
여러분이갖고있는의로운소망이 이루어지지않는다고느낄때가있을수도있습니다
There may be times when you feel that the righteous hopes you have are not being fulfilled
오전 10:39:35
여러분이갖고있는의문을소모하는분명히이루어집니다.
The doubts that you have will be clearly resolved.
오전 10:39:35

기적같이보이는이일들은그리스도를통해서가능하다는것을
These things that seem like miracles are possible through the Savior
오전 10:40:07
예수도의식이름으로간주중입니다.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
오전 10:40:19
안녕하세요정원의형제입니다
Hello I am Brother Garden
오전 10:40:27
말씀기회가안올줄알았는데오네요.
I did not think I would have the opportunity to speak.
오전 10:40:35
온것같습니다요즘 들어서세월이진짜많이흘렀다는생각을
It feels like time has really passed by a lot lately
오전 10:40:43
하게됩니다저희가이지역에왔을때만해도 은호가갓난얘기였거든요근데
When we first came to this area, the temple was just a newborn thing, but
오전 10:40:50
지금이번주가이번주형아따라서 유치원가겠다고네유치원OT를다녀왔어요
This week is the week to follow the example, so I went to kindergarten orientation to attend kindergarten.
오전 10:40:59
그리고이제지오도 일곱살인데내년이면학교를들어갑니다
And now my child is seven years old and will enter school next year.
오전 10:41:07
아그런거생각할때시간이정말빨리흘렀고 이게문득잊고지내는데아저도많이늙었구나라는
When I think about such things, time really passes quickly, and I suddenly realize that I have also become much older.
오전 10:41:13
생각을많이하게됩니다
I think a great deal.
오전 10:41:13
이제아이들이크다보니까이제아이들의이제앞으로의
Now the children are grown, so from now on the children's future
오전 10:41:23
진로라고해야되나요앞으로의 삶에대해서요즘고민을많이하는것같습니다
It seems they are having a lot of trouble concerning their future life and career these days.
오전 10:41:29
친구들도이제비슷한아이이제나이또래의아이를키우는데
Friends are now also raising children of a similar age, children of the same age group.
오전 10:41:36
그래서이런얘기를많이해요아이들교육뭐 가야되냐말아야되냐
So they talk a lot about this, what kind of education the children should receive, what they should do and what they should not do.
오전 10:41:43
영어유치원을보내야되냐말아야되냐이런얘기를 되게이야기를많이합니다. 주로
They have a lot of discussions about whether to send their children to an English kindergarten or not and such things, mainly.
오전 10:41:50
보통이렇게시작하죠와이프가이거시작했는데괜찮냐. 여기보냈는데너희는뭐너희도이거하고있냐잘하고있냐
It usually starts like this, my wife started this, is it okay. I sent it here, what about you, are you also doing this, are you doing well.
오전 10:41:57
이런이런것까지해줘야되냐막이런얘기를많이하는데
They often say things like do we have to do this and that and have many such conversations.
오전 10:42:03
결국이런걱정을하는 것에는한가지그런생각이있는거같아요그래서우리아이들을어떻게준비시켜야
Ultimately it seems there is one such thought in worrying about these things, so how should we prepare our children
오전 10:42:12
되나앞으로의세상에서이제 굶어죽지않고한사람몫을하게하려면은
In the world to come, in order to not starve to death but to have one's own portion,
오전 10:42:19
부모로서이제어떤준비를시켜줘야되냐라는그러한생각때문에이런얘기를많이하는 것같습니다.
As parents, they seem to be discussing these things a lot because of such thoughts as what kind of preparation they should make for their children now.
오전 10:42:27
이런이야기를많이하는이유가 지금세상이진짜빠르게변하고있기때문입니다.
The reason they have these conversations a lot is that the world is truly changing rapidly now.
오전 10:42:34
그뭐소금이나주식이나이런거에 세상돌아간뉴스를보고보시는분들은알고있겠지만
Those who watch the news about the world and its changes, such as stocks and commodities, will know
오전 10:42:40
정말빠르게변하고있어요AI관련해서 많은지금돈들이들어가고있고뭐로봇이나
Things are really changing quickly, a lot of money is being invested in relation to artificial intelligence, and robots and so on.
오전 10:42:48
이런쪽으로또이제많은자본들이들어가고있는데 어그런걸보고있으면은
As we see many capitals being invested in this area now
오전 10:42:56
결국인제인간의노동력은다개체가될텐데그러면 십년후에는당장십년후에뭘하고살뭘하고살고있을까
Ultimately human labor will be replaced by individual entities so then what will we be doing and living ten years from now, right now, what will we be doing and living.
오전 10:43:04
어떤직업이살아남고어떤직업이없어지고우리아이들은커서 뭘하고먹고살고있을까
What kind of occupations will survive and what kind of occupations will disappear, and what will our children be doing and living on when they grow up.
오전 10:43:13
이런또걱정을많이하게됩니다그래서항상그런요즘걱정으로뭐 이것저것하고있는데그러다저번주에
We have many such worries, so we are always doing various things due to these concerns, and last week
오전 10:43:22
를공부하면서 대해서공부를하는데그공부하는중에
while studying about that and studying the gospel
오전 10:43:29
제럴드코즈감독님의말씀이거기가첨부가돼있었어요그래서
The words of Elder Gerald Causse were attached there so
오전 10:43:30
말씀내용이제목이이제지상의청지기
The title of the message is now the steward of the earth
오전 10:43:39
부름이라는말씀이었는데그거를읽으면서한부분이 정말가슴에와닿았는데어떤부분이었냐면
It was a message about a calling and as I read it one part really touched my heart and that part was
오전 10:43:48
우리의창조주와함께협력하여그분의 자녀들에게육신을제공하고그들의
Our Creator works with us to provide bodies for His children and their
오전 10:43:55
신성한잠재력에도달할수있도록돕는일부 더신성하고보람을주며또많은것이요구되는청기기
Some sacred and demanding and many things are required to help reach divine potential.
오전 10:44:03
직분이없습니다딱이 부분을읽으면서아이게
There is no priesthood in that part as I read it and felt
오전 10:44:10
지금여기가지금하고있는부모로서고민하고있는그런부분에대한 답이아닌가라는생각을좀하게됐습니다
Now as a parent I have been pondering and worrying about such parts and I have come to think that perhaps this is the answer to those concerns.
오전 10:44:17
그래서아이들의신성한잠재력이란무엇일까요? 지금보기에는너무애들어리고
So what is the divine potential of the children, it seems too early to see now
오전 10:44:25
할줄도모르고걱정이많이되지만 이아이들도우리와마찬가지로주님의형상대로창조되었고
Although we do not know what to do and have many worries, these children were also created in the image of the Lord, just like us.
오전 10:44:32
아마주님도세상을창조하시고우리인간을창조하고
The Savior also created the world and created us humans
오전 10:44:32
주님처럼될수있는잠재력을가지고있다는것입니다
They have the potential to become like the Lord.
오전 10:44:42
지상에보내셨을때똑같은걱정을하셨을것같아요 아직이놈들선악이뭔지는모르는데
When the Savior sent us to the earth, He might have had the same concern, for these people do not know the difference between good and evil yet.
오전 10:44:49
지금이렇게보내놓으면다시돌아올수나있을까? 집을잘찾아올수있을까이런아마걱정을하셨을것같아요.
Will they be able to return if sent now, will they be able to find their way home, the Savior might have had such concerns.
오전 10:44:58
하지만그럼에도주님은우리에게자유의지를주셔서 스스로선택할수있게해주셨고그런
But nonetheless the Lord gave us free will so that we can choose for ourselves and
오전 10:45:07
선택을통해서우리의신성한잠재력을 스스로키울수있는기회를주셨습니다그리고
and through this choice we have the opportunity to develop our divine potential ourselves and
오전 10:45:14
복음을또전해주셨고예수그리스도를말해주셔서 우리들이돌아올수있는또방편을마련해주셨습니다.
He preached the gospel and testified of Jesus Christ, providing a way for us to return.
오전 10:45:21
우리아이들이걱정된다고이렇게길을다정해주시지 정해주시지않았어요오히려그것은사탄의방법이었습니다
The Savior did not provide a way for our children to be worried in this manner, nor did He predetermine it, for that would be the method of Satan.
오전 10:45:31
서글픈마음이들었어요부모마음에
I felt sorrow in my heart, a heart like that of my parents.
오전 10:45:31
이런생각을했을때
When I had these thoughts
오전 10:45:40
아이들이항상순탄하게자랐으면 좋겠는데아마그런일은벌어지지않을것같다
I wish the children could always grow up smoothly, but it seems that will not happen.
오전 10:45:48
라는생각을하게됐고앞으로부모로서마음을조금단단히먹어야겠다 라는생각을하게됐습니다
I have come to think that as a parent, I must make up my mind a little more firmly from now on.
오전 10:45:56
그렇다면부모로서나는이제무엇을아이들에게 주어야되느냐를고민해봤을때
Then as a parent I thought about what I should give to my children now
오전 10:46:04
생각났던게우리아이들이이제보복안에서자랄수있게울타리를잘 만들어줘야겠다그리고그아이들이선택하는데도움될수있는좋은모범을
I thought that I should build a good fence so that our children can grow up safely, and also be a good example to help them make choices.
오전 10:46:12
보여주어야겠다라는생각이들었습니다 세상에자립도물론중요하고하지만영적으로도자립할수있게
I thought that I should show them that it is not only important to be independent in the world, but also to be spiritually independent.
오전 10:46:21
것을도와줄수있을지를지금부터잘궁리하겠다는생각이많이되었습니다 그리고또이제코세감독님의말씀중에또이런말씀이있었는데
I have had many thoughts about how I can help them and I will think deeply about it from now on, and also there was another statement from the words of the apostle, which said
오전 10:46:31
형제자매여러분우리는주님께서모든것이영적인것이 사실을기억해야합니다우리삶에서가장세상적인측면에서도말입니다
Brethren and sisters, we must remember that the Savior said all things are spiritual, even in the most worldly aspects of our lives.
오전 10:46:40
우리가지금제가이렇게했던우리가하고있는이런
We are now doing what we have done like this, we are doing this kind of thing
오전 10:46:41
아이들관련해서뭐세상적이든영적이든이런고민들이
Regarding the children, whether it be worldly or spiritual, these concerns exist
오전 10:46:50
결국은우리를우리가족을강화시켜주고그리고우리가 더나은사람이될수있게도와주고있다는사실또한알게되었습니다
Ultimately I have come to know that it strengthens us and our family and also helps us to become better people.
오전 10:47:03
이번주에
This week
오전 10:47:10
참석할수하게됐어요장례식에가서 고모가말한걸말씀
I was able to attend and at the funeral, I heard the words of my aunt
오전 10:47:17
고모부에대해서말하는걸말씀하시는걸드렸는데 그이야기를들으면서사실몇가지가떠올랐어요.
As I listened to the words about my uncle, several things actually came to mind.
오전 10:47:25
이렇게이거뭐야말씀준비하면서듣고있었기때문에 첫번째들었던생각이나는이제그렇다면
As I was preparing to listen to these words, the first thought that came to my mind is now that I have heard them
오전 10:47:33
우리아이들에게어떤유산을남겨둘것인가.
What kind of legacy will we leave for our children.
오전 10:47:40
우리친구들이랑얘기하면항상이런얘기에요아들이두이니까아빠 아파트두개두채필요하다남겨줘야된다
When I talk to my friends, they always say that since I have two sons, I need to leave two apartments for them, two houses.
오전 10:47:46
이런얘기를하는데정말그런물론그런의선도있겠지만
While having this conversation, of course, there are certainly those kinds of righteous people.
오전 10:47:47
그고모가이게말씀하시면서이제고모도의삶에대해서
The apostle spoke like this, now regarding the life of my aunt
오전 10:47:55
의사는삶에대해서얘기하면서 그러한영적인유산들
The doctor spoke about life and such spiritual inheritances
오전 10:48:02
영적인유산들도중요한게아닐까 라는그런생각을했고그리고두번째가이제
and I had the thought that spiritual inheritances are also important and secondly now
오전 10:48:09
우리가이렇게막취업에고민하고막뭐어떻게보면아등바등살고있는데 뭐주님께서부르시면가야되는구나
When we are struggling with employment and barely making a living, we must go when the Savior calls us.
오전 10:48:16
그런시간이오겠구나라는생각을했습니다. 그래서우리가돌아가는날에우리의청지기직분에대해
I thought that such a time would come, so on the day when we return, regarding our stewardship priesthood
오전 10:48:25
보고해야되는순간이올텐데그때어떤보고를하게될까 그런걸많이보고싶고
I wonder what kind of report we will have to give at that time, and I want to see many of those reports.
오전 10:48:33
아까유실관련해서저진짜열심히살고성공해서우리 아이들에게아파트한채씩물려줬어요근데
I was really diligent and successful regarding the inheritance, so I was able to leave an apartment to each of our children.
오전 10:48:40
아이들이다시돌아올지는잘모르겠습니다. 라고할수도있겠고아니면
I do not know if the children will return or not, and
오전 10:48:48
저진짜열심히살았고좀힘들긴했지만
I really lived diligently and it was a bit difficult
오전 10:48:54
열심히살았고그리고아이들이잘돌아올수있게 준비잘시켜놨으니까 여기서조만간다시볼수있을거라예상합니다라고
I lived diligently and prepared well for the children so they can return safely, so I expect to see them again soon from here.
오전 10:49:05
보고를하게될지잘모르겠지만 우리가그런주님은벌써
But I do not know if I will report it, but our Savior is already
오전 10:49:13
때어떤보고를하게될지지금부터잘준비해야겠다는생각을 하게됐습니다.
I have come to think that I must prepare well from now on for whatever report I will give, but our Savior is already helping me through the Atonement and the priesthood authority of the apostle.
오전 10:49:22
잠깐아까얘기했던것처럼우리가이런치안사항속에 속에서걱정하고깨달은것들이
As we discussed a little while ago, the things we worry about and realize in the midst of these challenges
오전 10:49:29
우리의가족을강화시켜주고더나아가우리가 주님께더나아갈수있게해주었다는것을제가알고있습니다.
I know that it has strengthened our family and further allowed us to draw closer to the Savior.
오전 10:49:35
그래서이런것들을아이들이랑더나눌수있는기회가있었으면좋겠고.
So I wish we had more opportunities to share these things with the children.
오전 10:49:36
좋겠다는생각을했습니다주님이우리를사랑하신다는것에
I thought it would be good to testify of the Savior's love for us
오전 10:49:45
알고있고그렇기때문에이세상을창조해줬고 우리를지상에보내시고자유
He knows and therefore created this world and sent us to the earth with freedom
오전 10:49:52
의리를주셔서선택하게해주셨고또주님이 겪으셨던그런것들을우리도겪을수있도록
He gave us agency to choose and also allowed us to experience the things that the Savior experienced.
오전 10:50:01
우리가족을주시고그래서이가족을통해서우리가또배우고 또성장하고또기쁨을느낄수있도록해
He looks after our family and therefore through our family we can also learn and grow and feel joy.
오전 10:50:09
것을제가알고있습니다이모든것을예수그리스도이름으로 전해드립니다
I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ
오전 10:50:09
일정만불러오겠습니다.
I will bring the schedule.
오전 10:51:50
안녕하십니까이행희자매입니다. 오늘청라와드로이동하신다섯분의
Hello I am Sister Haenghee, today five people are moving to Cheongna Ward
오전 10:51:57
장로님자매님환영합니다.
Elders and sisters, welcome.
오전 10:52:06
비관자맥 한승.
I am grateful for the Savior's Atonement and the gospel that brings us joy and peace.
오전 10:52:19
오늘말씀해주신 오이진장해님하고정한식홍태님
Today the apostle Elder Oaks and Elder Holland taught us
오전 10:52:25
말씀을듣고있자니제가준비한말씀이 아주비슷합니다저는
As I listened to the words, the message I had prepared is very similar, I
오전 10:52:32
천구백팔십일년도에심리를받았습니다.
It was tried in the year nineteen hundred and eighty one.
오전 10:52:39
수원에있는수원신품아비서 투표를받았고요그것은
The vote was received in Suwon at the Suwon temple and it was
오전 10:52:45
어린시절에 낡은건물이있었고
In my childhood, there was an old building
오전 10:52:55
지금처럼겨울이면얼어죽은
like now when it is winter and frozen
오전 10:52:55
호기심많은저에게는굉장히좋은놀이터가되었습니다
It became a very good playground for me who was full of curiosity.
오전 10:53:07
비둘기들이많이있었거든요비둘기들땅을 언땅을파고그것을묻어주기도하고
There were many pigeons, the pigeons would peck at the frozen ground and cover it.
오전 10:53:13
여름에는송충이를잡아서
In the summer, we would catch cicadas.
오전 10:53:25
또혹여학을옛날에는
In the old days, perhaps sometimes
오전 10:53:34
음바구에서그런것을팔았어요혹여나터뜨리고 이상한요리를하기로했습니다지금생각해도정말부끄러운데요.
In the market perhaps they sold such things and maybe they decided to try and make strange dishes, even now it is really embarrassing.
오전 10:53:42
그런저의추억의장소에어느날이상한하얀동물이들어섰습니다
In that place of memories, one day a strange white animal appeared.
오전 10:53:48
저는친구들과그곳을지나가면서어느날 그건물에대해서이야기하면서
I was passing by that place with my friends one day and talking about that building
오전 10:53:55
그런데참이상하다여기가빌라라고하는데십자가가없다 이야기를하면서지나가고있었습니다
We were passing by while talking about how strange it is that this place is called a villa but there is no cross.
오전 10:54:03
그런데때마침우리를보고어느형제님께서 교회의문을활짝놓으시고저희를
Then just in time a brother of the church saw us and opened the gate of the church widely and
오전 10:54:03
안으로들어오라고안내하시는것이었습니다
that was guiding us to enter inside
오전 10:54:14
일층에있는예배당을먼저부동시켜주셨고 이층계단올라가서어느방분하나를놓고가셨을
The Savior first allowed us to move the chapel on the first floor and then went up the stairs on the second floor and left one room behind.
오전 10:54:22
하셨습니다그리고그안에는두분의선교사님이 장로님이계셨는데 갈색을한장로님한분과
and inside there were two missionaries, elders, one of whom was an elder with brown color and
오전 10:54:31
파란색운을한눈동자를가진그런장문운이 계셨습니다저는그분들에게
There was an apostle with blue eyes and brown hair who was present, and I was with them
오전 10:54:32
이교회가왜십자가가없는지에대한질문을던졌습니다.
I asked a question about why this church did not have a cross.
오전 10:54:42
그랬더니그분들은저에게다음약속을잡으면서 자세하게설명해주겠노라고하셨습니다
They told me that they would explain it in detail when we make our next appointment.
오전 10:54:50
그것이저의처음교회를방문하고 분노를하게된계기가되었습니다.
That became the occasion for my first visit to the church and the opportunity to receive the gospel and feel the Savior's love, which led me to repentance.
오전 10:54:57
저는그분들과토론을하면서 복음을쉽게받아들이지는않았습니다.
I did not easily receive the gospel while discussing with them.
오전 10:55:06
이미그전에제가어린시절에감리교육을다닌적이있었고 하나님에대해서는알고있었지만이교회가참된것인지에대한확신은
Before I immigrated, I had attended Presbyterian education in my childhood and I knew about God, but I did not have a conviction about whether this church was true.
오전 10:55:15
없었습니다 장부님들은정말저희를열심히가르쳐
The elders really taught us diligently
오전 10:55:26
가르쳤습니다그리고그분들은어떻게든저에게다음약속을 했습니다저는약속을지키기위해교회갔고
They taught and they made me a promise and I went to church to keep the promise
오전 10:55:32
또토론을했지만침례를결심침례결심을하지는못했습니다.
We had another discussion but I could not make a decision to be baptized.
오전 10:55:39
그러던어느날이었는데그분들은 아주좋아하는초코파이를제가사라지고가서
One day they who loved chocolate cake very much went somewhere after I disappeared
오전 10:55:45
항상맛있게잘드시던초코파이를
the chocolate pie that was always deliciously eaten
오전 10:55:45
이렇게같이먹을수있게끔분들에게드렸습니다
The Savior gave this so that people could eat together like this.
오전 10:55:53
날만큼은그별들이드시지않았습니다그리고저는왜안드시냐고
The stars were not more numerous than the days and I asked why you did not eat
오전 10:55:53
물었더니그분이하시는말씀이
He said that
오전 10:56:02
자매님저는오늘 자매님을위해서금식하고기도하고있어요이렇게말씀하실
He said that I am fasting and praying for you today, sister.
오전 10:56:10
것이었습니다 저는그때솔직히너무나놀랐고나를위해
It was that I was honestly very surprised and for me
오전 10:56:17
금식을한다고고마우면서도 사실그일은저의마음을조금움직이게되었습니다.
Fasting was good, but that incident actually moved my heart a little.
오전 10:56:27
집에돌아오면서집으로가는길에 집에와서도그일에대해서생각해보았습니다.
On the way home and after arriving home, I thought about that incident.
오전 10:56:35
나는이부분이옳고조세스미스가 첫번째시연을보았다는것에대한그런것이지
I thought that part was right and that Joseph Smith saw the first vision regarding such things.
오전 10:56:42
옳은지는모르겠다그렇지만분명한건이교회에는 사랑이있는것같다.
I am not sure if it is right, but one thing that is certain is that there is love in this church.
오전 10:56:51
예수그리스도께서저희에게가장중요한것이 사랑이라고말씀하셨는데
The Savior said that the most important thing for us is love.
오전 10:56:52
내가이교회에서
I am in this church
오전 10:56:59
들어오는것도괜찮지않을까라는생각을하게되었습니다
I thought that it would be all right to come in
오전 10:57:00
그리고저는시간이흘러
And as time passed
오전 10:57:10
장로님들에게이교회는정말좋은교회인것 갔다잘은모르지만그리고더노력해서
Elders, this church is really a good church, although I do not know well, and I will try harder
오전 10:57:17
관심을갖도록해보겠다라며진리를받게된것같습니다 신뢰를받을때저는선교사가가르쳐준대로
It seems that I have come to receive the truth by saying that I will try to have interest, and when I gain trust, I will do as the missionaries have taught me.
오전 10:57:27
성신을느껴보려고했지만사실특별한느낌이나감동을받지못해서 심리를받고나서도저는선도자가가르쳐준대로
I tried to feel the Holy Ghost but actually did not receive any special feelings or impressions, so even after the interview, I did as the leader taught me
오전 10:57:34
성찬식에와야한다기에그저성찬식만참석하고 금세사라져버리는그런아이였습니다.
He was a child who would only come to the sacrament meeting and then immediately disappear.
오전 10:57:42
그렇지만사십오년전에그런제가 아직도교회에남아있고이렇게여러분앞에서이야기를하고
But forty-five years ago, such a person as I am still remains in the church and is speaking in front of you like this
오전 10:57:48
있습니다어떤일이있었을까요?
What kind of event could have occurred
오전 10:57:49
성찬식에만겨우참석하던
who barely attended the sacrament meeting
오전 10:57:58
제가어쩌다세미나리에가게되었고경전을공부하고 성문수천식에서누군가의말씀과간증을
I ended up attending a seminar and studying the scriptures and at the temple where someone's words and testimony
오전 10:58:05
하는것을귀담아듣게되고또시간이많이흘러 스스로조용한곳을찾아무릎을꿇고기도하게되었습니다.
I came to listen attentively to someone's words and testimony and after much time had passed I found myself seeking a quiet place to kneel down and pray.
오전 10:58:14
이복음은인간의자유의지를존중하고 어느교회보다정직하고투명하게
This gospel respects human free will and is more honest and transparent than any church.
오전 10:58:20
올바르게운영되어되고있었고무엇보다중요한건복음의참배단을 지식과가능성이조금씩싹트기시작했습니다.
It was being operated correctly and what is most important is that the gospel's worship group began to sprout with knowledge and possibility.
오전 10:58:30
나의친구는꿈속에서기도응답을받았다고도하고 어떤이는성전에서기도하며천둥같은
My friend also said they received an answer to their prayer in a dream and some prayed in the temple with a thunderous
오전 10:58:38
주님의음성을들었다고간증을하는데 저에겐그모든것이어려운숙제였던것같습니다
They testified that they heard the Lord's voice, but to me, all those things seemed like difficult homework.
오전 10:58:48
그러나시간이흐르면서 하나님의존재에대해조금씩인정하게되고
However, as time passed, I came to acknowledge the existence of God a little at a time.
오전 10:58:55
그분께서주신사랑을깨닫게되었습니다. 갑자기드라마틱한변화가있었던것도아니었고
I came to realize the love that the Savior gave, it was not a sudden dramatic change
오전 10:59:06
같은명성을들은것도아니지만또꿈속에서선명한응답이나 가르침을받지는못했어도작은음성에서
I did not hear the same fame nor did I receive clear answers or teachings in dreams but in a small voice
오전 10:59:13
따뜻하고평온한느낌에서성신이있었다는것을깨닫게되었습니다
I came to realize that the Holy Ghost was present in the warm and peaceful feeling
오전 10:59:20
그리고나는교회를입은또한아주작고단순한일을 한형제님에게도
And I also saw the church clothed in a very small and simple thing by a brother
오전 10:59:26
나를인내와사랑으로가르쳐준선교사님에게도 간증은없었지만친밀을받겠다고결심한제마음속에서도
The missionaries who taught me with patience and love also had no testimony, but in my heart, I had determined to receive intimacy
오전 10:59:34
성신이함께했음을느낍니다
I feel the Holy Ghost was with me
오전 10:59:43
우리는인생에큰산이나타났을때그크기에압도당하고 뒷걸음질하고좌절하기도합니다긴시간이흘러도
We often feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of great mountains that appear in life and take a step back and become discouraged even after a long time has passed
오전 10:59:51
응답되지않는기도도있습니다어려움을소나기처럼한꺼번에 도저히피할수없게쏟아지기도합니다.
There are also unanswered prayers and difficulties that pour down like a sudden rain, making it impossible to avoid them all at once.
오전 10:59:58
그럴때여러분은어떻게하시나요? 여러분은어떤해결책을갖고계시나요?
At that time, how do you handle it, and what solutions do you have?
오전 11:00:06
저는여러분과다름없는방법을사용합니다.
I use a method that is no different from yours.
오전 11:00:14
첫번째로저는월운경을매일공부하고 기도합니다. 월말경은읽다가좋은말씀
Firstly, I study the scriptures daily and pray, the scriptures are read and good words of the gospel
오전 11:00:21
기록하고그말씀에대해생각합니다 말씀에서주님께서내게주시고자하는메시지를찾으려고합니다
I record and ponder those words, seeking the message the Lord desires to give me from the scriptures.
오전 11:00:30
제가얼마전물먹이형마지막장을읽고덮으면서 일기장에이렇게기록했습니다
I recently read the last chapter of the Book of Mormon and wrote this in my journal
오전 11:00:36

오전 11:00:45

I wrote the words in verse nineteen, He is unchangeable, He is God from the beginning.
오전 11:01:00
지금도기적의하나님이시니라. 두번째로성은을평온하고안식일을지킵니다.
Now He is the God of miracles, secondly keep the Sabbath day and rest.
오전 11:01:07
안식일에모임에참석하고성산을취합니다. 안식일에그리스도의대석을기억하고정결하게되는경건한시간입니다.
On the Sabbath, attend meetings and take the sacrament, it is a sacred time to remember the Atonement of Christ and become clean.
오전 11:01:16
축복의장소가됩니다그곳에서받은영감이
that place is a place of blessing where the inspiration received
오전 11:01:16
입니다성전은거룩한의식을행하고위안과영광을
The temple is where holy ordinances are performed and comfort and glory are
오전 11:01:25
커다란퍼즐의한조각처럼아주작은것일지라도 그것을붙잡고의미를찾으려애씁니다
Even if it is very small like a piece of a large puzzle, we must hold on to it and try to find its meaning.
오전 11:01:26
넬슨회장님은주님은참으로여러분의마음과뜻을우리에게알려주지

He said that God truly speaks to you, does He want to say something to you?
오전 11:01:43

Yes, He said, the Savior serves according to the guidance of the Holy Ghost.
오전 11:01:51

He gave us the priesthood to act in His name and to serve, and since we have a lot of time and are economically comfortable
오전 11:01:57
모든상황이할만하니까하는봉사가아닙니다. 그럼에도불구하고기꺼이기쁘게하는봉사입니다.
The service is not just because every situation is manageable, but rather it is a willing and joyful service.
오전 11:02:07
발이주님이보시기에얼마나고귀하고기뻐하시는일인가에
How precious and joyful it is in the sight of the Savior
오전 11:02:07
오랜세월저는주님을위해봉사하는연약한사람의소망과
For a long time, she has been the hope of a weak person serving the Savior
오전 11:02:17
를깨닫게되었습니다연로하셔서그건한분 한봉다니기도어려운데항상어김없이
I came to realize that even though they are old and it is hard for one person to do it alone, they still serve without fail.

When I ask her, she says she has many worries, even the employees are concerned.

Did the Savior teach you, if we share the gospel, miracles can occur in small things
오전 11:04:15
